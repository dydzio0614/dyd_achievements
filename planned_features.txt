Legendary achievements - separate category, very hard to get
Temporary achievements - separate category?
Bugfix report achievements (handy, isn't it?)
Killstreak achievements
Player speed reached achievements
Achievement completion sound
Prerequirements
Mind blow bolt - missile with repeater's main fire fx, target receives limb_break
Levelable special abilities - for example missile with demp main fx that can get damage, speed, extra missiles like bowcaster, special effects on hit, depending on completed achievements
Teleport mine/detpack blowup achievement
